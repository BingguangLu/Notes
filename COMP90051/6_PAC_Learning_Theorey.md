# 6 PAC Learning Theorey

Generalisation and Model Complexity

Theory we've seen so far (mostly statistics)

- Asymptotic notions (consistency, efficiency)
- Convergence could be really slow
- Model complexity undefined

Want: finite sample theory; convergence rates, trade-offs

Want: define model complexity and relate it to test error

- Test error can't be measured in real life, but it can be provably bounded!
- Growth function, VC dimension
